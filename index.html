				<h3>What Is Enterprise?</h3>

				</div><br style="clear: both;">

				<p>Enterprise (named after the Starship Enterprise from <i>Star
				Trek</i>) is an EFI program that is designed to assist in booting Linux
				distributions from USB sticks on UEFI-based PCs and Macs, something that is
				continously regarded as being near to impossible due to quirks in vendors'
				EFI implementations and really quite poor support from Linux
				distributions. Using Enterprise, you can create bootable USB drives
				that boot on a UEFI-based computer <strong>without</strong> needing
				rEFIt or rEFInd to be installed.</p>

				<p>The program is quite unique. It is written in C, and can be compiled
				to run on both 32-bit and 64-bit EFI firmware types. Right now, all
				official downloads are for <strong>64-bit EFI firmware architectures</strong>
				only. Be aware that certain 64-bit Macs have 32-bit EFI firmwares, and
				the supplied Enterprise binaries won't work on these platforms.</p>

				<p>Enterprise was originally designed to compliment <a href=
				"https://sevenbits.github.io/Mac-Linux-USB-Loader/" target="_blank">Mac
				Linux USB Loader</a>, though it can also be used separately on any UEFI-based
				computer. The purpose of Enterprise is as the first stage in a
				two-stage booting process for Mac Linux USB Loader-created USB
				drives.</p>

				<p>Please note that this page is oriented for technical users, such as
				hardware and/or software enthuasists, programmers, and people who like to
				hack their firmware. It is not intended for casual users - beware!</p>

				<h4>The Basics</h4>

				<p>Once upon a time, everything was happy in computer-land. Our PCs were
				booting, our memory sufficed, and the children were happy. But then Mr.
				Turing had to curse us with the &lt;sarcasm&gt; evil of technological
				progress &lt;&#8260;sarcasm&gt;, and eventually our nice, peaceful
				solutions didn't work anymore. All of a sudden, our multi-terabyte drives
				couldn't be booted from, and our old 16-bit BIOSes couldn't boot our
				cool, newfangled 64-bit multicore operating systems. Woe was us!</p>

				<p>But our computer engineers, clever as they are, dug up an old, largely
				forgotten future-proof boot specification, UEFI. And from there, the rest
				is history.</p>

				<h4>Installation and Use</h4>

				<p>Enterprise is not really intended to be installed in the same
				manner as one would install a traditional bootloader like GRUB. Owing to
				its origins and nature, Enterprise is fairly easy to configure and doesn't
				require writing anything to the Master Boot Record of a hard drive, and it
				only consists of a few files which can be trivially copied in any sane
				operating system.</p>

				<p>If you want to get the best performance from Enterprise and take advantage
				of any super cool stuff I add to it, you should
				<a href="https://github.com/SevenBits/Enterprise/archive/master.zip">download the
				source code</a>, as the official repository includes a number of tools
				to assist in setup.</p>

				<p>However, for beginners and casual users, you should begin by
				downloading the Enterprise binaries. You can do that at the pane to the
				left. Then you need to set up a configuration file on your USB drive
				named <code>enterprise.cfg</code> which tells Enterprise details about
				the distribution that you want to boot from your USB drive. Here's a
				sample file:</p>
				<script src="https://gist.github.com/SevenBits/466f078ac3dfbd028a4b.js"
				type="text/javascript">
</script>

				<p>In order to function properly, Enterprise needs to know the location
				of the Linux kernel and the initial RAM disc inside of the ISO file. The
				configuration file gives this information to Enterprise, which then passes
				this information along to the boot loader when it is time to load the
				operating system.</p>

				<p>The configuration file consists of a number of <code>entry</code>s, each
				of which defines a particular distribution or option which you want to
				have. At the very minimum, each <code>entry</code> should contain <em>at
				least</em> the <code>family</code> parameter. This tells Enterprise which
				distribution you are trying to boot and loads default options based on
				this. All of these default options can be overwritten. Currently, the
				options accepted by the <code>family</code> parameter are:</p>

				<table>
					<thead>
						<tr>
							<th>Distribution Family</th>

							<th>Default Values</th>
						</tr>
					</thead>

					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td>Ubuntu</td>

							<td><strong>kernel:</strong> <code>/casper/vmlinuz</code> <br/>
							<strong>initrd:</strong> <code>/casper/initrd.lz</code></td>
						</tr>

						<tr>
							<td>Debian</td>

							<td><strong>kernel:</strong> <code>/live/vmlinuz</code> <br/>
							<strong>initrd:</strong> <code>/live/initrd.img</code></td>
						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>

				<p>Naturally, the <code>kernel</code> and <code>initrd</code> parameters
				can be altered by adding the respective line to the
				<code>enterprise.cfg</code> file. This is demonstrated above with the
				<code>kernel</code> parameter. You can pass a variety of additional
				options, including:</p>

				<table>
					<thead>
						<tr>
							<th>Parameter Name</th>

							<th>Effect</th>
						</tr>
					</thead>

					<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td>entry</td>

							<td>Used to mark the start of a new boot option. All future
							options will apply to the newly-created entry. There must be
							at least one entry in a file for it to be valid.</td>
						</tr>

						<tr>
							<td>family</td>

							<td>Specifies the distribution family (e.g Ubuntu, Debian,
							etc) and sets the other options accordingly. This parameter
							is required if you do not want to specify any other
							options.</td>
						</tr>

						<tr>
							<td>initrd</td>

							<td>Specifies, relative to the root of the ISO, the absolute
							path to the Linux initial RAM disc.</td>
						</tr>

						<tr>
							<td>iso</td>

							<td>The path to the ISO that you wish to associate with this
							particular entry relative to the location of the Enterprise
							binary. If not specified, it defaults to
							<code>boot.iso</code>.<br>
							<strong>Warning:</strong> The behavior of this parameter may
							change in the future.</td>
						</tr>

						<tr>
							<td>kernel</td>

							<td>Specifies, relative to the root of the ISO, the absolute
							path to the Linux kernel.<br>
							<strong>Note:</strong> It is possible to pass custom options
							to this kernel by specifying them after the path. See above
							for an example.</td>
						</tr>

						<tr>
							<td>root</td>

							<td>Specifies the location of the kernel and initrd. Passed
							to the Linux kernel as <code>boot=XXX</code>, where XXX is
							the value of this parameter.</td>
						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>

				<h4>Contributions</h4>

				<p>For those of you in the know, I code using a style called <a href=
				"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Variant:_1TBS" target=
				"_blank">1TBS</a> - or, the one true brace style. I quite like it. So
				much so, in fact, that it's the required syntax style (just so things
				don't get messy). For those of you who are not familiar with it, it is
				best demonstrated with an example:</p>

				<div style=
				"background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em;">
				<pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">
<span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">if</span> (<span style=
"color: #007020">true</span>) {
		bob();
} <span style="color: #008800; font-weight: bold">else</span> {
		sam();
}
</pre>
				</div>

				<p>That should suffice for an explanation. Looking forward to seeing how
				everyone uses this!</p>
