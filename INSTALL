To build Enterprise on your platform, run

    ./build.sh

If Docker is installed and running on your build computer, the
build will be performed inside of a Docker container. This is
the recommended process for building because it eliminates
problems that will likely stem from all of the different variants
of software that exist on different computers and operating system
variants.

This script should work on both Linux and macOS. Other platforms
are untested.

If you don't have Docker installed, you will need to have GNU-EFI
installed in order to complete the build. It is recommended that
you use the included script install-deps.sh to do so.

Once compiled. the Enterprise binary will appear in the bin/ folder
at the root of the project.
